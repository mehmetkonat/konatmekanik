    <p class="mainpage" >I worked as an electronics responsible for ITU Hydros team.
     <br>Our project was carried out with the aim of enabling a boat 
        designed as an unmanned boat to navigate efficiently as a 
        result of cutting its contact with water by means of hydrofoils.

     <br>We had the opportunity to compete our project in the Switzerland-based 
        2018 HydroContest competition, which was held for the fifth time in 
        Saint Tropez, France.
