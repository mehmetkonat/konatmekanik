    <br><h1>  ITU Hydros Team</h1>
    <p>I worked as an electronics responsible for ITU Hydros team.
    </p>
    <p>Our project was carried out with the aim of enabling a boat 
        designed as an unmanned boat to navigate efficiently as a 
        result of cutting its contact with water by means of hydrofoils.
    </p>
    <p>We had the opportunity to compete our project in the Switzerland-based 
        2018 HydroContest competition, which was held for the fifth time in 
        Saint Tropez, France.
